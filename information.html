    <p>LUNDI STUDIO is a communication design practice led by curiosity, specialising in being playful, and thinks that collaboration = a good time.</p>
    <br>
    <p>Our interests and skillsets span many, and our projects are varied. From photography to type design, from branding and coding to ceramics. If youâ€™re curious about a project, reach out.</p>
    <br>
    <p>Located in Melbourne and Berlin, LUNDI recognises the importance of reflecting on the past and understanding the context of the present, acknowledging the complexities of history that inform where we stand today. LUNDI acknowledges the lands of the Wurundjeri and Boon Wurrung peoples of the Kulin Nations, whose sovereignty was never ceded, and whose land we are grateful to create and connect upon today. We pay our respects to their Elders, past, present and emerging, and extend that respect to all Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander peoples. <a href="https://paytherent.net.au/" class="hyperlink" target="_blank">Pay The Rent.</a></p>
